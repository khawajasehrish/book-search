1) How long did you spend on the coding assignment? 
   4 - 6 hours.
  a) What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
  
  b) If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
     - add spinner for API calls. I added a state for loading. I would have used that for showing and hiding   the spinner.
     - add sorting functionality through latest publish date.
     - imporve styling
     - add more test cases for sorting
     - if there are multiple input fields and validation, react-hook-form can be used.
2) What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
     - currently at my job I am using react-hook-form while handling form data. I found that its a very useful feature. its easy, flexible and reuseable. I didn't get chance to showcase that in this project since there is only one input field.  
3) How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
  - last time when one of my project was in production, the bundle size was very big due to routes, images and fontawesome. To solve that I have implemented react lazy routes to split the bundle.
4) How would you improve the API that you just used?
  - lot of repeatative information in json files. duplicate data needs to be removed. 
  - need to improve documentation. 
5) Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON.
